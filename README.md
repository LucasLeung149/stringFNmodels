# StringyFNQuarksEnv
Latest Version of the code: updated 19 October, 2024.

Mathematica code for computing flavour parameters for string FN models. This package is implemented in arXiV:2410.XXXXX. The main use of the package is to act as the GA Environment to be used with the package linked in https://github.com/harveyThomas4692/GAMathematica.

## Installation
To launch the code, the package "StringyFNQuarksEnv.wl" should be put in the "Applications" folder in the Mathematica directory ("$Home_Dir$/./Mathematica/Applications). The home directory can be found by running 
```
$HomeDirectory
```
Then you should be able to run the following command
```
<<StringyFNQuarksEnv`
```
in a Mathematica cell in a Mathematica notebook. This should launch the package. For details of the package and its use, type 
```
?StringyFNQuarksEnv 
```
after the package is launched. This contains the details of the different options and functions in the package.

## Examples
The Mathematica notebook "stringyfnquarksenv_egs.nb" gives a list of useable functions and an example of each of their use.
